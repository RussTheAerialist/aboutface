*This project is in initial development.  More information will be coming later*

About:Face is an art project where an automated camera takes pictures of people
and then displays them along side similar looking people.

I'm looking for collaborators on this project, so if interested in collaborating,
please open an issue.  Local to Seattle prefered since there is hardware involved.
